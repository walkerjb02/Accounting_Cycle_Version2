# In the first iteration of my accounting cycle program, I talked about adding in a blockchain component that allows the user to verify the inegrity of any infomation that's in the storage. So, using my remake of the SHA-256 algorithm, I added the aforementioned feature into the program. I didn't add in a PoW protocol as there's only one node (the user) in the chain. Futhermore, because my remake of SHA-256 is in Python, as opposed to C which is what hashlib is written in, adding PoW would make the program very, very slow. I would like to maybe learn C so I could make a faster version but that will not be happening for a little bit. Going back to the accounting program, though, you will see it is geared more toward financial accounting. I would like to add components that focus on the managerial side of things like budgets, CVP, etc. So, stay tuned for that feature.
